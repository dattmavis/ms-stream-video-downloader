# ms-stream-video-downloader
A lightweight Python GUI tool leveraging yt-dlp to download Microsoft Teams / Stream (Classic) or SharePoint-hosted video recordings using a captured videomanifest URL and exported cookies.txt. I use it in my workflow for Whisper transcribing meetings and summarizing meetings I don't have proper-download access to and no transcription was made.
